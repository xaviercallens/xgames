play   # or ./launch_bomberman.sh
```

---

## 📊 **Training Progress**

### **Expected Performance:**

| Training | Time | Episodes | Win Rate |
|----------|------|----------|----------|
| **Bootstrap** | 5 min | 500 | 30-40% |
| **+ Quick** | +5 min | +400 | 45-55% |
| **+ Extended** | +15 min | +1200 | 60-70% |
| **Multiple Sessions** | Varies | 3000+ | 70-80%+ |

---

## 🎯 **Recommended Training Path**

### **Day 1:**
```bash
# Complete pipeline (10 min)
./train.sh → Option 1

# Test
./launch_bomberman.sh

# Result: 50-60% win rate
```

### **Day 2:**
```bash
# Quick training (5 min)
./train.sh → Option 3

# Result: 55-65% win rate
```

### **Day 3:**
```bash
# Extended training (15 min)
./train.sh → Option 4

# Result: 65-75% win rate
```

### **Ongoing:**
```bash
# Quick sessions as needed
./train.sh → Option 3

# Result: Continuous improvement
```

---

## 🛠️ **Environment Variables**

After running `setup_terminal.sh`, these are set:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PROJECT_DIR:$PYTHONPATH
BOMBERMAN_HOME=$PROJECT_DIR
```

**Aliases:**
```bash
train    # ./train.sh
play     # ./launch_bomberman.sh
bomber   # cd $BOMBERMAN_HOME
```

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **"No module named 'pygame'"**

```bash
# Run setup again
source setup_terminal.sh

# Or install manually
pip install pygame torch numpy
```

---

### **"Virtual environment not found"**

```bash
# Create it
python3 -m venv game_dev_env

# Run setup
source setup_terminal.sh
```

---

### **Training seems stuck**

The warnings are normal! Training is working. Look for:
```
Episode 50/500 | Avg Reward: 12.34 | Win Rate: 15.2%
```

---

### **Want to start fresh**

```bash
./train.sh → Option 6 (Reset & Restart)
```

---

## 💡 **Tips**

### **1. Use Aliases:**
```bash
source setup_terminal.sh  # Sets up aliases
train                     # Quick access to training
play                      # Quick access to game
```

### **2. Check Progress:**
```bash
./train.sh → Option 7 (View Statistics)
```

### **3. Regular Training:**
```bash
# 5-minute sessions daily
./train.sh → Option 3
```

### **4. Save Terminal Setup:**

Add to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:
```bash
# Auto-setup Bomberman environment
if [ -f ~/CascadeProjects/windsurf-project-2/setup_terminal.sh ]; then
    source ~/CascadeProjects/windsurf-project-2/setup_terminal.sh
fi
```
