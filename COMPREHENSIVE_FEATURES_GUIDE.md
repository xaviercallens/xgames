## Integration Guide

### Step 1: Initialize Systems

```python
from bomber_game.ai_selector import AISelector
from bomber_game.game_recorder import GameRecorder
from bomber_game.game_recap import GameRecap
from bomber_game.ai_level_manager import AILevelManager

# Show AI selection menu
selector = AISelector(screen)
selected_ai = selector.show()

# Create recorder
recorder = GameRecorder()
recorder.set_initial_state(game_state)

# Initialize level manager
level_manager = AILevelManager()
```

### Step 2: During Gameplay

```python
# Record actions
recorder.record_move(player_name, old_pos, new_pos)
recorder.record_bomb_placed(player_name, position)
recorder.record_powerup_collected(player_name, type, position)

# Record frames (sampled every 10 frames)
recorder.record_frame(game_state, sample_rate=10)
```

### Step 3: End of Game

```python
# Finish recording
recorder.finish_recording(winner_name, statistics)

# Export data
json_file = recorder.export_json()
compressed_file = recorder.export_compressed()
summary_file = recorder.export_summary()

# Show recap screen
recap = GameRecap(screen, game_stats, recorder.get_statistics(), selected_ai)
action = recap.show()

if action == 'export':
    print(f"Data exported to: {json_file}")
elif action == 'continue':
    # Restart game
    pass
elif action == 'quit':
    # Exit
    pass
```

### Step 4: Model Management

```python
# After training
if new_win_rate > old_win_rate:
    level = level_manager.save_model_at_level(
        model.state_dict(),
        win_rate=new_win_rate,
        episodes=total_episodes
    )
    
    # Check for promotion
    if level_manager.promote_model(current_level, new_win_rate):
        print("🎉 Model promoted to higher level!")
```
