## 🏆 Model Selector Decision

### Current Status
```
📊 Available Models:
   • Enhanced Heuristic: 29% baseline
   • PPO Model: ✅ Found (4,043 episodes)
   • Pretrained Model: ✅ Found
   • Training Sessions: 10

📈 PPO Model Performance:
   Total Episodes: 4,043
   Overall Win Rate: 5.8%
   Recent Win Rate: 21.0% (last 100 episodes)
   Improvement: +18.8% (from 2.2%)

⚖️  Performance Comparison:
   PPO Model:     5.8%
   Heuristic:     30.0%
   Difference:    -24.2%

🌱 Decision: Use Heuristic Agent
   Reason: Heuristic outperforms PPO by 24.2%
   💡 PPO needs more training to beat heuristic
```

## 💡 Analysis

### What Worked
✅ **Significant Improvement:** From 2.2% to 21% win rate  
✅ **Stable Learning:** Recent performance shows consistency  
✅ **Reward Growth:** Average reward increased dramatically  
✅ **Multiple Sessions:** Training resumed successfully across sessions  

### Challenges
⚠️ **Still Below Heuristic:** 21% vs 30% baseline  
⚠️ **Needs More Training:** Target is 40-55% win rate  
⚠️ **Overall Win Rate Low:** Dragged down by early poor performance  

### Why Recent Performance is Better
1. **Learning Curve:** Agent learned basic strategies
2. **Experience:** 4,000+ episodes of training data
3. **Reward Optimization:** Better understanding of game mechanics
4. **Stable Policy:** Less random exploration, more exploitation

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate
1. **Continue Training** - Target 10,000+ episodes
   ```bash
   ./start_overnight_training.sh
   ```

2. **Longer Sessions** - Run for 8+ hours continuously
   - Current best: 1 hour sessions
   - Recommended: Full overnight (8 hours)

3. **Monitor Progress**
   ```bash
   python monitor_training.py
   ```

### Long-term Goals
- **Target Win Rate:** 40-55%
- **Episodes Needed:** ~10,000-15,000
- **Training Time:** ~20-30 hours total
- **Beat Heuristic:** Consistently outperform 30% baseline
