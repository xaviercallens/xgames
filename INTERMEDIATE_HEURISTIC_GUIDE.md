- Simple danger map evaluation
- Random decision-making
- No strategic planning
- Fixed behavior patterns
- ~30% win rate

### After (Intermediate Smart)
- Multi-level threat assessment
- Strategic bomb placement with lookahead
- Adaptive tactics based on game state
- Opponent modeling
- **Target: 45-55% win rate**

---

## 🧠 Core Systems

### 1. **Threat Assessment System** ⚠️

**Features**:
- ✅ Multi-level threat classification (critical, high, medium, low, safe)
- ✅ Exact blast zone calculation
- ✅ Position-based threat scoring
- ✅ Safe zone detection
- ✅ Time-based danger evaluation

**Threat Levels**:
```
Critical (100): Immediate death
High (75):      Very dangerous
Medium (50):    Dangerous
Low (25):       Minor threat
Safe (0):       Safe position
```

**Usage**:
```python
threat_level, threat_score = ThreatAssessment.assess_position_threat(x, y, game_state)
safe_pos = ThreatAssessment.find_safe_zone(player_x, player_y, game_state)
```

### 2. **Strategic Planning System** 🎯

**Features**:
- ✅ Bomb placement evaluation with lookahead
- ✅ Wall destruction value calculation
- ✅ Power-up detection and prioritization
- ✅ Enemy threat assessment
- ✅ Escape route validation

**Strategic Decisions**:
```python
should_bomb, value, escape_routes = StrategicPlanning.evaluate_bomb_placement(...)
powerup_target = StrategicPlanning.find_power_up_target(...)
wall_target = StrategicPlanning.find_wall_target(...)
```

### 3. **Adaptive Behavior System** 🎮

**Features**:
- ✅ Dynamic aggression level (0.0-1.0)
- ✅ Opponent strength assessment
- ✅ Tactical adjustment based on game state
- ✅ Pursuit decision-making
- ✅ Defensive/aggressive switching

**Aggression Levels**:
```
0.1:  Very defensive (winning)
0.4:  Defensive (weaker)
0.5:  Balanced
0.7:  Fairly aggressive (stronger)
0.8:  Aggressive (much stronger)
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Threat Assessment

**Blast Zone Calculation**:
```
1. Start at bomb position
2. Expand in 4 directions
3. Stop at hard walls
4. Include soft walls then stop
5. Return all affected tiles
```

**Position Threat Scoring**:
```
1. Check all bombs and explosions
2. Calculate time-based danger
3. Sum threat scores
4. Classify threat level
5. Return level and score
```

### Strategic Planning

**Bomb Placement Evaluation**:
```
1. Check escape routes (must have ≥1)
2. Count walls that would be destroyed
3. Check for power-ups revealed
4. Check for enemy threats
5. Calculate total value
6. Apply escape route bonus
7. Return decision and value
```

**Target Selection Priority**:
```
1. Opponent (if close and aggressive)
2. Power-ups (if available)
3. Walls (if strategic)
4. Safe movement (fallback)
```

### Adaptive Behavior

**Aggression Update**:
```python
if opponent.alive:
    if player.bomb_range > opponent.bomb_range:
        aggression = 0.8  # Stronger
    elif player.max_bombs > opponent.max_bombs:
        aggression = 0.7  # Slightly stronger
    else:
        aggression = 0.4  # Weaker
else:
    aggression = 0.1  # Winning
```

## 📊 Decision-Making Flow

```
Game State
    ↓
Assess Current Threat
    ↓
Critical Threat?
    ├─ YES → Escape immediately
    └─ NO → Continue
    ↓
Evaluate Bomb Placement
    ↓
Decide Target
    ├─ Pursue opponent? (if aggressive)
    ├─ Collect power-up? (if available)
    ├─ Destroy wall? (if strategic)
    └─ Safe movement (fallback)
    ↓
Move & Place Bomb
    ↓
Track Statistics
```

## 🎮 Gameplay Behavior

### Defensive Mode (Aggression < 0.5)
- ✅ Prioritizes safety
- ✅ Avoids risky bomb placement
- ✅ Collects power-ups
- ✅ Destroys walls strategically
- ✅ Maintains escape routes

### Balanced Mode (Aggression = 0.5)
- ✅ Balanced safety/aggression
- ✅ Opportunistic bomb placement
- ✅ Pursues nearby opponents
- ✅ Collects power-ups
- ✅ Strategic wall destruction

### Aggressive Mode (Aggression > 0.5)
- ✅ Pursues opponents actively
- ✅ Places bombs strategically
- ✅ Seeks confrontation
- ✅ Aggressive wall destruction
- ✅ Calculated risks
