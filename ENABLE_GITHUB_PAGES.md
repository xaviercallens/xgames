# Enable GitHub Pages - Action Required

**Status:** ⚠️ **Manual Configuration Needed**

The web demo files are ready, but GitHub Pages needs to be configured in your repository settings.

---

## 🎯 Quick Fix (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Go to Repository Settings

1. Open: **https://github.com/xaviercallens/xgames**
2. Click **"Settings"** tab (top right)
3. Click **"Pages"** in left sidebar

### Step 2: Configure GitHub Pages

**Source Section:**
- Change from: `Deploy from a branch`
- **To: `GitHub Actions`** ← This is the key change!

That's it! The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically deploy.

---

## 📊 What This Does

### Before (Current - Not Working)
```
GitHub tries to deploy from branch → Jekyll processing → 404 errors
```

### After (Will Work)
```
GitHub Actions workflow → Upload all files → Deploy → ✅ Working!
```

---

## ⏰ Timeline After Configuration

| Step | Time | What Happens |
|------|------|--------------|
| **Configure Pages** | 0 min | You change setting to "GitHub Actions" |
| **Workflow Triggers** | ~30 sec | GitHub Actions starts automatically |
| **Build & Deploy** | 1-2 min | Uploads and deploys all files |
| **CDN Propagation** | 1-2 min | Content distributed globally |
| **Total** | 2-4 min | Demo is live! |

---

## 🌐 Expected Result

After configuration, these URLs will work:

### **🎮 Main Demo**
```
https://xaviercallens.github.io/xgames/docs/play/index.html
```

### **📚 Documentation**
```
https://xaviercallens.github.io/xgames/docs/index.html

## 🔍 Verification

### After Changing Settings:

1. **Check GitHub Actions Tab**
   - Go to: https://github.com/xaviercallens/xgames/actions
   - Look for: "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
   - Should show: 🟢 Running or ✅ Completed

2. **Wait 2-4 Minutes**
   - Workflow needs time to build and deploy

3. **Test the URL**
   ```bash
   curl -I https://xaviercallens.github.io/xgames/docs/play/index.html
   # Should return: HTTP/2 200
   ```

4. **Open in Browser**
   - Visit: https://xaviercallens.github.io/xgames/docs/play/index.html
   - Should see: Game demo loading

## 🛠️ What We've Already Done

✅ Created `.nojekyll` files
✅ Added GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`)
✅ Pushed all changes to main branch
✅ All demo files are in the repository

**Only Missing:** GitHub Pages configuration (requires manual setting change)

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If You Don't See "GitHub Actions" Option

**Possible Causes:**
1. Repository is private (GitHub Pages requires public repo or GitHub Pro)
2. GitHub Pages not enabled for your account
3. Browser cache issue (try hard refresh)

**Solutions:**
1. Make repository public: Settings → General → Danger Zone → Change visibility
2. Or upgrade to GitHub Pro for private repo Pages support

### If Workflow Doesn't Run

1. Check Actions tab is enabled:
   - Settings → Actions → General
   - Allow all actions and reusable workflows

2. Manually trigger workflow:
   - Actions tab → "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
   - Click "Run workflow" button

### If Still Getting 404 After Deployment

1. **Clear browser cache**: Ctrl+Shift+R
2. **Wait longer**: Sometimes CDN takes 5-10 minutes
3. **Check workflow logs**: Actions tab → Click on workflow run
4. **Verify files**: Check workflow uploaded correct files

## 📞 Quick Commands to Check Status

### Check if workflow ran:
```bash
# View recent workflows
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/xaviercallens/xgames/actions/runs | grep -A 5 "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
```

### Test if page is live:
```bash
curl -I https://xaviercallens.github.io/xgames/docs/play/index.html
# Should return: HTTP/2 200 (not 404)
```

### Check last deployment time:
```bash
curl -I https://xaviercallens.github.io/xgames/ | grep last-modified
```

## 💡 Why This Is Needed

GitHub Pages has two deployment methods:

### Method 1: Deploy from Branch (Old Way)
- ❌ Uses Jekyll by default
- ❌ Can cause 404 errors
- ❌ Limited control
- ❌ Not working for our setup

### Method 2: GitHub Actions (New Way - Recommended)
- ✅ Full control over deployment
- ✅ No Jekyll issues
- ✅ Deploys exactly what you want
- ✅ Better for modern web apps
- ✅ **This is what we need!**

---

## 🎉 After Configuration

Once you change the setting to "GitHub Actions":

1. **Workflow runs automatically** (triggered by our push)
2. **Deploys in 2-4 minutes**
3. **Demo is live** at the URL
4. **Future pushes** auto-deploy (no manual steps needed)
