## 🌟 Visual Showcase

### Character Animation
```
Frame 0: Legs down, eyes forward
Frame 1: Legs up (bobbing), eyes forward
→ Smooth looping animation
```

### Bomb Pulsing
```
Timer 3.0s: Normal size
Timer 1.5s: Slight pulse
Timer 0.5s: Large pulse (about to explode)
→ Visual indication of urgency
```

### Explosion Effect
```
