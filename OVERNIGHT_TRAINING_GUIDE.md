```

### Generate Plots

```bash
# Generate performance plots

## 🔄 Resume Training

### Automatic Resume

The script automatically resumes from the latest checkpoint:

```bash
# Just run again - it will find and load the latest checkpoint
python3 overnight_training.py
```

### Manual Resume from Specific Checkpoint

Edit `overnight_training.py`:

```python
# In train_overnight() function, modify:
checkpoint_path = "bomber_game/models/checkpoints/checkpoint_ep500_best_*.pth"
agent = PPOAgent(agent_player, model_path=checkpoint_path, training=True)
```

---

## 🎮 Using the Trained Model

### Play Against Trained AI

```bash
# The game automatically uses the best model
python3 play_bomberman.py
```

### Test Model Performance

```bash
# Run benchmark tests
python3 quick_test_agent.py
```

### Compare Models

```bash
# Compare different checkpoints
python3 -c "
from bomber_game.model_selector import ModelSelector
selector = ModelSelector('bomber_game/models')
print(selector.get_performance_report())
"
```

## 📊 Expected Results

### Training Timeline

**First Hour (0-1h):**
- Episodes: ~500-800
- Win Rate: 10-20%
- Learning basic movement and bomb placement

**Hours 2-4:**
- Episodes: 1,500-3,000
- Win Rate: 20-35%
- Developing strategic play

**Hours 5-8:**
- Episodes: 4,000-8,000
- Win Rate: 35-50%+
- Refined tactics and positioning

### Performance Targets

| Metric | Good | Excellent |
|--------|------|-----------|
| Win Rate (vs Heuristic) | 40%+ | 55%+ |
| Avg Reward | 50+ | 100+ |
| Episodes/Hour | 500+ | 800+ |

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Training Not Starting

```bash
# Check if PyTorch is installed
python3 -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"

# Install if missing
pip3 install torch
```

### Low Performance (Slow Training)

```bash
# Check CPU usage
top

# Reduce update interval for faster training
# Edit overnight_training.py:
UPDATE_INTERVAL = 2048  # Smaller = faster but less stable
```

### Out of Memory

```bash
# Reduce batch size
# Edit overnight_training.py:
BATCH_SIZE = 64  # Smaller = less memory
```

### Training Plateaus

The script has automatic plateau detection:
- Stops if no improvement for 50 episodes
- Saves best model before stopping
- Check logs for plateau warnings

### Resume Not Working

```bash
# Check for checkpoint files
ls -lh bomber_game/models/checkpoints/

# Manually specify checkpoint
# Edit overnight_training.py to load specific checkpoint
```

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### 1. System Preparation

```bash
# Ensure system won't sleep
sudo systemctl mask sleep.target suspend.target

# Or use caffeine/similar tools
```

### 2. Resource Allocation

- Close unnecessary applications
- Ensure adequate disk space (>1GB)
- Monitor temperature if on laptop

### 3. Optimal Settings

- Start with default settings
- Adjust based on first hour results
- Larger `UPDATE_INTERVAL` = more stable
- Smaller `LEARNING_RATE` = slower but safer

### 4. Monitoring Strategy

```bash
# Terminal 1: Training
nohup python3 overnight_training.py > training.log 2>&1 &

# Terminal 2: Monitor
python3 monitor_training.py

# Terminal 3: System resources
htop
```

### 5. Post-Training

```bash
# Generate final plots
python3 monitor_training.py --plots

# Print summary
python3 monitor_training.py --summary

# Test the model
python3 play_bomberman.py
```

---

## 🚀 Advanced Usage

### Custom Reward Function

Edit `calculate_reward()` in `overnight_training.py`:

```python
def calculate_reward(game_state, agent_player, enemy_player, prev_state, action):
    # Customize rewards here
    reward = 0
    
    # Your custom logic
    if custom_condition:
        reward += custom_value
    
    return reward
```

### Hyperparameter Tuning

Create a tuning script:

```python
# hyperparameter_search.py
learning_rates = [1e-4, 3e-4, 5e-4]
clip_epsilons = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]

for lr in learning_rates:
    for clip in clip_epsilons:
        # Run training with these parameters
        # Compare results
```

### Multi-Agent Training

Train against multiple opponents:

```python
# Rotate opponents during training
opponents = [
    ImprovedHeuristicAgent,
    SimpleAgent,
    PPOAgent  # Self-play
]
```

---

## 📞 Support

### Check Training Status

```bash
# View last 50 lines of log
tail -n 50 bomber_game/models/training_log.txt

# Watch log in real-time
tail -f bomber_game/models/training_log.txt
```

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Training stops unexpectedly
**Solution:** Check `training_log.txt` for errors

**Issue:** Win rate not improving
**Solution:** Adjust reward function or learning rate

**Issue:** Memory errors
**Solution:** Reduce `BATCH_SIZE` and `UPDATE_INTERVAL`
