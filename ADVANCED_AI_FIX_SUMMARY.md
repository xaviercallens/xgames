# üêõ Advanced Smart Heuristic - Update Method Fix

## Issue

When selecting "Advanced Bot (Smart)" from the AI mode selector, the game crashed with:
```
‚ùå Error: 'AdvancedSmartHeuristic' object has no attribute 'update'
```

## Root Cause

The `AdvancedSmartHeuristic` class was missing the `update()` method that the game engine calls every frame to get the AI's action.

## Solution

Added the `update()` method to the `AdvancedSmartHeuristic` class with:

### Implementation Details

```python
def update(self, dt, game_state):
    """
    Update agent with timing control.
    
    Args:
        dt: Delta time in seconds
        game_state: Current game state
        
    Returns:
        Current action tuple (dx, dy, place_bomb)
    """
    self.think_timer += dt
    
    if self.think_timer >= self.think_delay:
        self.think_timer = 0
        # Get opponent from game state
        opponent = None
        for player in game_state.players:
            if player != self.player:
                opponent = player
                break
        
        if opponent:
            self.current_action = self.choose_action(self.player, opponent, game_state)
        else:
            self.current_action = (0, 0, False)
    
    return self.current_action if self.current_action else (0, 0, False)
```

### Key Features

- **Timing Control**: Uses `think_timer` and `think_delay` to throttle decision-making
- **Opponent Detection**: Finds opponent from `game_state.players` list
- **Action Caching**: Stores current action and returns it each frame
- **Fallback**: Returns (0, 0, False) if no action is ready
- **Consistent Interface**: Matches the signature of other AI agents

### Changes Made

**File**: `bomber_game/heuristics_advanced.py`

1. Added timing attributes to `__init__`:
   ```python
   self.think_timer = 0
   self.think_delay = 0.15  # Thinking delay in seconds
   self.current_action = None
   ```

2. Added `update()` method after `choose_action()` method

## Testing

‚úÖ Code compiles without errors
‚úÖ Game launches successfully
‚úÖ Advanced Bot (Smart) can be selected
‚úÖ Game runs without crashing
‚úÖ AI makes decisions properly

## Commits
