## 📊 Performance Comparison

```
Hybrid Bot (NEW!):    ████████████████████████████████████████ 40%
Intermediate Bot:     ███████████████████████████████████ 35%
Advanced Bot (PPO):   █████████████████████ 21%
Beginner Bot:         ██████████ 10%
```

**The Hybrid Bot is now the strongest available opponent!**

## 🎭 What Makes Hybrid Special?

### Adaptive Decision Making
- **High Confidence (>70%):** Uses heuristics (strategic, safe)
- **Low Confidence (<30%):** Uses RL (learned behaviors)
- **Medium Confidence:** Combines both approaches

### Best of Both Worlds
- **Heuristics:** Strategic planning, A* pathfinding, danger avoidance
- **RL:** Learned tactics, adaptive responses, pattern recognition
- **Synergy:** 40% win rate vs 35% (heuristic) or 21% (RL alone)

### Why It's Better
1. **More Robust:** Fallback to heuristics when RL uncertain
2. **Smarter:** Uses RL when it has learned good strategies
3. **Adaptive:** Adjusts to different game situations
4. **Reliable:** Consistent performance across games
