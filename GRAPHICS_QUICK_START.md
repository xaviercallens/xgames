## Technical Details

### Graphics Module
- **File**: `bomber_game/enhanced_graphics.py`
- **Functions**: 7 rendering functions
- **Colors**: 8 predefined colors
- **Animations**: Sine waves, scaling, alpha blending

### Rendering Order
1. Background (green checkerboard)
2. Walls (textured)
3. Cacas (poop piles)
4. Bombs (cloud effects)
5. Explosions (expanding clouds)
6. Power-ups (rotating squares)
7. Players (detailed characters)
8. UI (stats)

### Animation Techniques
- **Sine waves**: Smooth pulsing and bobbing
- **Scaling**: Growing/shrinking effects
- **Alpha blending**: Transparency effects

## Customization

To modify graphics, edit `bomber_game/enhanced_graphics.py`:

```python
# Change colors
PROUT_GREEN = (100, 200, 50)

# Change animation speed
pulse = 1.0 + 0.3 * math.sin(timer * 8)  # Adjust multiplier

# Change effect size
radius = int((tile_size // 2) * 1.2)
```
