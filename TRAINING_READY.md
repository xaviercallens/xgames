# ✅ Training is Ready!

All bugs have been fixed. Here's what to do:

## 🧹 Clear Python Cache (IMPORTANT!)

```bash
# Clear all cached .pyc files
find . -type d -name __pycache__ -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null
find . -name "*.pyc" -delete 2>/dev/null
```

## 🚀 Start Training

```bash
./start_overnight_training.sh
```

Or for quick start:

```bash
./quick_train.sh
```

## 🐛 All Fixes Applied

1. ✅ Added missing `deque` import
2. ✅ Fixed GameState reset (recreate instead of calling reset())
3. ✅ Fixed episode variable scope
4. ✅ Fixed PPOAgent method (use `choose_action`)
5. ✅ Fixed ImprovedHeuristicAgent method (use `choose_action`)
6. ✅ Fixed Player.move() parameters (added grid, tile_size, game_state)
7. ✅ Fixed bomb placement (use `game_state.place_bomb(player)`)
8. ✅ Fixed GameState.update() parameters (needs dt)

## ⚠️ Important

**Always clear Python cache before running training!**

Python caches compiled .pyc files and may run old code even after you edit the source.

## 🧪 Test Before Training

```bash
python test_training.py
```

This will verify everything works before starting the 8-hour training.
