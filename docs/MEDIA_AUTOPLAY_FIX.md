# Media Autoplay Fix for Web Demo

## Problem
Browser security policies prevent audio/video from autoplaying without user interaction. This caused the following errors:
- **MEDIA USER ACTION REQUIRED** - Audio blocked by browser
- **Canvas2D willReadFrequently warning** - Performance optimization needed

## Solution Implemented

### 1. User Engagement Overlay
Added a prominent, visually appealing overlay that:
- Appears when the page loads and media engagement is required
- Features a large, animated "START GAME" button
- Provides clear instructions to users
- Automatically hides once user clicks anywhere on the page

### 2. Canvas Performance Optimization
Fixed the Canvas2D warning by adding the `willReadFrequently: true` attribute to the canvas context, which optimizes performance for games that frequently read pixel data.

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- **Gradient animated button** with pulse effect
- **Clear messaging** explaining why interaction is needed
- **Click anywhere** functionality - entire overlay is clickable
- **Automatic media engagement** triggered on user interaction

## Technical Changes

### CSS Additions
- `#user-engagement-overlay` - Full-screen overlay with dark backdrop
- `.start-button` - Gradient button with hover effects and pulse animation
- `.start-message` - Clear instructional text

### JavaScript Enhancements
- `showEngagementOverlay()` - Displays the overlay when needed
- `hideEngagementOverlay()` - Hides overlay and triggers media engagement
- Canvas context optimization with `willReadFrequently: true`
- Event listeners for both overlay and button clicks

## User Flow
1. Page loads â†’ Overlay appears with "START GAME" button
2. User clicks button or anywhere on overlay
3. Overlay fades away
4. Media engagement is triggered
5. Game starts normally with audio enabled

## Browser Compatibility
This solution works with all modern browsers that enforce autoplay policies:
- Chrome/Edge (v66+)
- Firefox (v66+)
- Safari (v11+)
- Mobile browsers

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Open the web demo page
2. You should see the overlay with the START GAME button
3. Click the button or anywhere on the overlay
4. The game should start without media errors
5. Audio should play normally

## Notes
- The overlay only appears when media engagement is required
- Once user interacts, the flag is set and won't show again during the session
- The Canvas2D warning should no longer appear in the console
