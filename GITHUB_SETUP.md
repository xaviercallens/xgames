# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## 🔑 SSH Key Setup

### Your SSH Public Key (copy this exactly):
```
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIMNVPzhKzizSlZWTR3TkcFb3Dm05xqdoL3hEyD7wEbjp xavier@xgames-dev
```

## 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name**: `xgames`
3. **Description**: `Python Game Development Environment - 2D/3D Games with Pygame, Panda3D`
4. **Visibility**: Public (or Private if you prefer)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Add SSH Key to Your GitHub Account
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/keys
2. Click **"New SSH key"**
3. **Title**: `XGames Development Key`
4. **Key type**: `Authentication Key`
5. **Key**: Paste the SSH key from above (the entire line)
6. Click **"Add SSH key"**

### Step 3: Push Your Code
After completing steps 1 and 2, run these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /home/kalxav/CascadeProjects/windsurf-project-2

# Test SSH connection
ssh -T git@github.com

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## 🚀 Alternative: Using HTTPS (if SSH doesn't work)

If you prefer to use HTTPS instead of SSH:

```bash
# Remove SSH remote
git remote remove origin

# Add HTTPS remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/xaviercallens/xgames.git

# Push (will prompt for GitHub username/password or token)
git push -u origin main
```

## 📁 What Will Be Uploaded

Your repository will contain:
- ✅ Complete game development environment
- ✅ 5 working game examples
- ✅ Utility modules and documentation
- ✅ Setup and activation scripts
- ✅ Requirements and configuration files

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied" error:
- Make sure you created the repository at: https://github.com/xaviercallens/xgames
