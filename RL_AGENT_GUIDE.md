# 🤖 Reinforcement Learning Agent Guide

## 🎯 **Overview**

The Trump Man game now features a **sophisticated AI agent** powered by **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)**, a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning technique!

---

## ✨ **Features**

### **1. Deep Q-Network (DQN)**
- **Neural network** with 4 layers (128→128→64→actions)
- **State representation**: 179 features (grid + game state)
- **Action space**: 10 actions (move + bomb combinations)
- **Experience replay** for stable learning
- **Target network** for improved convergence

### **2. Intelligent State Representation**
The agent observes:
- ✅ **Full grid** (13x13 = 169 values)
- ✅ **Player position** (normalized)
- ✅ **Enemy position** (normalized)
- ✅ **Bomb count** and availability
- ✅ **Nearest bomb distance**
- ✅ **Danger level** (in explosion range?)
- ✅ **Power-up count**
- ✅ **Alive status**
- ✅ **Can place bomb?**

### **3. Smart Action Space**
```python
Actions = [
    (0, 0, False),   # Stay
    (0, -1, False),  # Up
    (0, 1, False),   # Down
    (-1, 0, False),  # Left
    (1, 0, False),   # Right
    (0, 0, True),    # Place Bomb
    (0, -1, True),   # Bomb + Up
    (0, 1, True),    # Bomb + Down
    (-1, 0, True),   # Bomb + Left
    (1, 0, True),    # Bomb + Right
]
```

### **4. Reward System**
```python
+100  Win (defeat enemy)
-100  Loss (get defeated)
+10   Destroy soft wall
+5    Collect power-up
+1    Move closer to enemy
-1    Move away from enemy
-0.1  Each step (encourage efficiency)
```

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### **Option 1: Play with Pre-trained Agent** (Recommended)

If you have a pre-trained model:

```bash
# Place model at: bomber_game/models/rl_agent.pth
./launch_bomberman.sh
```

The game will automatically use the RL agent if the model exists!

### **Option 2: Train Your Own Agent**

#### **Step 1: Install PyTorch**
```bash
# CPU version (recommended for learning)
pip install torch torchvision

# OR GPU version (faster training)
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

#### **Step 2: Train the Agent**
```bash
# Train for 1000 episodes (takes ~30-60 minutes)
./train_rl_agent.py

# Or with custom parameters
python train_rl_agent.py
```

#### **Step 3: Play with Your Trained Agent**
```bash
./launch_bomberman.sh
```

## 📊 **Training Process**

### **What Happens During Training:**

1. **Episode Start**: Agent spawns, enemy spawns
2. **Action Selection**: 
   - Early: Random exploration (ε=1.0)
   - Later: Learned policy (ε→0.01)
3. **Environment Step**: Execute action, update game
4. **Reward Calculation**: Based on outcome
5. **Experience Storage**: Save (state, action, reward, next_state)
6. **Learning**: Train neural network on batch of experiences
7. **Repeat**: Until episode ends or max steps reached

### **Training Output:**
```
Episode 10/1000 | Avg Reward: -15.23 | Avg Length: 234.5 | Win Rate: 10.0% | Epsilon: 0.904
Episode 20/1000 | Avg Reward: -8.45 | Avg Length: 189.2 | Win Rate: 15.0% | Epsilon: 0.817
...
Episode 1000/1000 | Avg Reward: 45.67 | Avg Length: 156.3 | Win Rate: 75.2% | Epsilon: 0.010
```

### **Training Progress:**
- **Episodes 1-100**: Random exploration, learning basics
- **Episodes 100-300**: Starting to avoid danger
- **Episodes 300-600**: Learning to attack enemy
- **Episodes 600-1000**: Mastering strategy, high win rate

## 🧠 **How It Works**

### **Deep Q-Learning Algorithm:**

```python
# 1. Observe state
state = get_state(game)

# 2. Choose action (ε-greedy)
if random() < epsilon:
    action = random_action()  # Explore
else:
    action = argmax(Q(state))  # Exploit

# 3. Execute action
next_state, reward = game.step(action)

# 4. Store experience
memory.append((state, action, reward, next_state, done))

# 5. Learn from batch
batch = sample(memory)
for (s, a, r, s', done) in batch:
    target = r + γ * max(Q(s'))  # Bellman equation
    loss = (Q(s)[a] - target)²
    optimize(loss)
```

### **Neural Network Architecture:**

```
Input (179 features)
    ↓
Dense(128) + ReLU
    ↓
Dense(128) + ReLU
    ↓
Dense(64) + ReLU
    ↓
Dense(10) → Q-values for each action
```

## 🔧 **Advanced Usage**

### **Customize Training:**

Edit `train_rl_agent.py`:

```python
# Training parameters
EPISODES = 2000  # More episodes = better agent
MAX_STEPS = 1000  # Longer episodes
SAVE_INTERVAL = 50  # Save more frequently

# RL parameters (in rl_agent.py)
self.epsilon = 1.0  # Initial exploration
self.epsilon_min = 0.01  # Minimum exploration
self.epsilon_decay = 0.995  # Decay rate
self.gamma = 0.95  # Discount factor
self.learning_rate = 0.001  # Learning rate
```

### **Monitor Training:**

```python
# Add to training script
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot(episode_rewards)
plt.xlabel('Episode')
plt.ylabel('Total Reward')
plt.title('Training Progress')
plt.show()
```

### **Evaluate Agent:**

```python
# Test trained agent
from bomber_game.agents import RLAgent

agent = RLAgent(player, model_path="bomber_game/models/rl_agent.pth")
wins = 0
for i in range(100):
    # Play game...
    if won:
        wins += 1
print(f"Win rate: {wins}%")
```

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **PyTorch Not Installed:**
```bash
pip install torch torchvision
```

### **CUDA Errors:**
```python
# Force CPU mode
device = torch.device("cpu")
```

### **Training Too Slow:**
- Reduce `EPISODES` to 500
- Reduce `MAX_STEPS` to 300
- Use GPU if available

### **Agent Not Learning:**
- Check reward function
- Increase exploration (higher epsilon)
- Train for more episodes
- Adjust learning rate
