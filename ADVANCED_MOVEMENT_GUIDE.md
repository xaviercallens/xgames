## 🎯 Problems Solved

### 1. **Character Blocked by Own Bombs** ✅
- **Problem**: Player could get stuck on their own bombs
- **Solution**: Smooth collision resolution with push-away mechanics
- **Result**: Player can now move freely without getting stuck

### 2. **Jerky Movement** ✅
- **Problem**: Movement felt unresponsive and blocky
- **Solution**: Smooth acceleration/deceleration system
- **Result**: Fluid, natural movement like classic Bomberman

### 3. **Wall Collision Issues** ✅
- **Problem**: Player could get stuck on corners
- **Solution**: Wall sliding mechanics
- **Result**: Smooth movement along walls

### 4. **Animation Sync** ✅

## 🚀 How It Works

### Smooth Movement Flow

```
1. Input Detection
   └─ Get keyboard input (WASD/Arrows)

2. Velocity Update
   └─ Smooth acceleration/deceleration
   └─ Apply friction
   └─ Clamp to max speed

3. Position Calculation
   └─ Calculate new position
   └─ Apply velocity * delta time

4. Collision Detection
   └─ Check walls
   └─ Check bombs
   └─ Check cacas
   └─ Check other players

5. Collision Resolution
   └─ Try wall sliding
   └─ Push away from bombs
   └─ Adjust position

6. Grid Snapping
   └─ Snap to grid when close
   └─ Clean positioning

7. Animation Update
   └─ Update animation frame
   └─ Sync with movement
```

### Bomb Collision Resolution

```
Player approaches bomb:
  ↓
Collision detected:
  ↓
Calculate push direction:
  └─ Vector from bomb to player
  └─ Normalize direction
  └─ Apply push distance (0.35 units)
  ↓
Check new position valid:
  └─ Not in wall
  └─ Not in other obstacle
  ↓
Apply new position:
  └─ Player pushed away smoothly
  └─ No getting stuck
```

### Wall Sliding Mechanics

```
Player hits wall:
  ↓
Try X-only movement:
  └─ If valid, allow sliding along Y
  ↓
Try Y-only movement:
  └─ If valid, allow sliding along X
  ↓
If both blocked:
  └─ Stop movement
```

## 📊 Movement Parameters

### Speed Settings
```python
max_speed = 8.0              # Maximum speed (tiles/sec)
acceleration = 25.0         # How fast to reach max speed
deceleration = 20.0         # How fast to stop
friction = 0.85             # Velocity decay factor
```

### Collision Settings
```python
collision_buffer = 0.15     # Buffer around player
slide_factor = 0.3          # Wall sliding factor
snap_distance = 0.1         # Distance to snap
snap_threshold = 0.05       # Threshold for snapping
```

### Sprint Settings
```python
sprint_multiplier = 1.5     # 50% speed boost
sprint_duration = 0.5       # 0.5 seconds
sprint_cooldown = 1.0       # 1 second cooldown
```

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Player still getting stuck
- **Solution**: Increase `collision_buffer` value
- **Check**: Bomb collision resolution is working

**Issue**: Movement feels too slow
- **Solution**: Increase `max_speed` or `acceleration`

**Issue**: Animation doesn't match movement
- **Solution**: Adjust animation `speed` values
- **Check**: Animation state is updating correctly

**Issue**: Player sliding too much
- **Solution**: Decrease `slide_factor` value
- **Check**: Wall collision detection is working
