# Create agent
ai = AdvancedSmartHeuristic(player)

# Choose action
dx, dy, place_bomb = ai.choose_action(player, opponent, game_state)

# Record result
ai.record_game_result(won=True, reward=100.0)

# Get stats
print(ai.get_stats_string())
```

### Configuration
```python
# Predictive Analysis
max_escape_paths = 10
max_lookahead_depth = 5

# Strategic Positioning
center_control_weight = 5.0
opponent_distance_weight = 10.0

# Game Tree
max_minimax_depth = 2
