### Quick Start

```bash
# Train with optimized PPO
python train_ppo_optimized.py
```

### Training Configuration

```python
# In train_ppo_optimized.py
EPISODES = 5000          # Total episodes
MAX_STEPS = 300          # Steps per episode
BUFFER_SIZE = 2048       # Experience buffer
SAVE_INTERVAL = 100      # Save every N episodes
EVAL_INTERVAL = 50       # Evaluate every N episodes
```

### Early Stopping

Training automatically stops when:

## 📈 Training Progress

### Expected Performance

| Episodes | Win Rate | Avg Reward | Notes |
|----------|----------|------------|-------|
| 0-100 | 5-10% | -50 | Random exploration |
| 100-500 | 15-25% | 0 | Learning basics |

### Monitoring Training

```bash
# Watch training progress
tail -f bomber_game/models/training_stats_optimized.json

# Check model files
ls -lh bomber_game/models/ppo_agent_optimized*
```

## 🎯 Hyperparameter Tuning

### For Faster Training (Less Accuracy)

```python
BUFFER_SIZE = 1024       # Smaller buffer
MAX_STEPS = 200          # Shorter episodes
self.epochs = 2          # Fewer epochs
self.mini_batch_size = 128  # Larger batches
```

### For Better Performance (Slower Training)

```python
BUFFER_SIZE = 4096       # Larger buffer
MAX_STEPS = 500          # Longer episodes
self.epochs = 6          # More epochs
self.mini_batch_size = 32   # Smaller batches
hidden_size = 256        # Larger network
```

### For Very Limited CPU

```python
hidden_size = 64         # Tiny network
BUFFER_SIZE = 512        # Small buffer
self.mini_batch_size = 32   # Small batches
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Training is Slow

1. **Check CPU threads**:
   ```python
   import torch
   print(torch.get_num_threads())  # Should be > 1
   ```

2. **Reduce network size**:
   ```python
   hidden_size = 64  # Instead of 128
   ```

3. **Increase batch size**:
   ```python
   self.mini_batch_size = 128  # Instead of 64
   ```

### Not Learning

1. **Check reward function**: Ensure rewards are balanced
2. **Increase buffer size**: More diverse experiences
3. **Adjust learning rate**: Try 1e-4 or 5e-4
4. **Check state representation**: Verify features are normalized

### Memory Issues

1. **Reduce buffer size**: `BUFFER_SIZE = 1024`
2. **Smaller network**: `hidden_size = 64`
3. **Clear GPU cache** (if using GPU):
   ```python
   torch.cuda.empty_cache()
   ```

## 📚 Advanced Features

### Curriculum Learning

Gradually increase difficulty:

```python
# Start with weak enemy
if episode < 500:
    enemy_ai = SimpleAgent(enemy_player)
# Then use stronger enemy
else:
    enemy_ai = PPOAgent(enemy_player, model_path="strong_model.pth")
```

### Parallel Training (Future)

```python
# Use multiple processes
from multiprocessing import Pool

def train_episode(seed):
    # Train one episode
    pass

with Pool(4) as p:
    results = p.map(train_episode, range(100))
```

### Transfer Learning

```python
# Load pretrained model
agent = OptimizedPPOAgent(
    player,
    model_path="bomber_game/models/ppo_agent.pth",  # Old model
    training=True
)
# Continue training with optimized version
```
