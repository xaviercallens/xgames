## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Player Management
```python
# Spawn positions (corners)
SPAWN_POSITIONS = [
    (1, 1),                    # Player 1 (Human)
    (GRID_SIZE-2, GRID_SIZE-2), # AI 1
    (GRID_SIZE-2, 1),          # AI 2
    (1, GRID_SIZE-2),          # AI 3
]

# Player colors
PLAYER_COLORS = [GREEN, RED, BLUE, YELLOW]
```

### AI Agent Creation
```python
for ai_config in player_config['ai_configs']:
    # Create player
    ai_player = game_state.add_player(...)
    
    # Create agent based on type
    if ai_type == 'hybrid':
        agent = HybridAgent(ai_player, mode='adaptive')
    elif ai_type == 'ppo':
        agent = PPOAgent(ai_player, model_path=...)
    else:
        agent = ImprovedHeuristicAgent(ai_player)
    
    ai_agents.append(agent)
```

### Game Loop
```python
# Update all AI agents
for ai_player, ai_agent in zip(ai_players, ai_agents):
    if ai_player.alive:
        action = ai_agent.choose_action(game_state)
        # Execute action
```
