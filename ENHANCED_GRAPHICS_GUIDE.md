# 🎨 Enhanced Graphics for PROUTMAN

## Overview

The PROUTMAN game now features **dramatically improved graphics** with a cohesive visual theme centered around the "Prout" (fart/trump) and "Caca" (poop) concept!

---

## 🎯 What's Been Enhanced

### 1. **Player Characters** 👤
- **Detailed body rendering** with head, body, and legs
- **Expressive eyes** that look in the direction the player is facing
- **Animated bobbing effect** during movement
- **Color-coded players** (Green for Player, Red for AI)
- **Outline and shine effects** for depth
- **Smooth sub-pixel positioning** for fluid movement

### 2. **Prout Bombs** 💨
- **Smelly cloud effect** with green and yellow puffs
- **Animated stink lines** that wave around the bomb
- **Pulsing animation** that intensifies as timer runs out
- **Brown spots** (caca marks) on the prout
- **Realistic fart cloud appearance** with layered colors

### 3. **Caca Obstacles** 💩
- **3-stacked poop piles** with realistic shading
- **Animated stink lines** rising from the caca
- **Shine/highlight effect** for visual appeal
- **Pulsing visibility** to show it's an active obstacle
- **Brown color palette** matching the concept

### 4. **Explosions** 💥
- **Dramatic expanding cloud effect** with multiple layers
- **Fade-out animation** for smooth transitions
- **Stink particles** radiating outward
- **Color progression** from green (outer) to brown (inner)
- **Enhanced visual impact** with concentric circles

### 5. **Walls** 🧱
- **Hard walls** (indestructible) with stone texture and cracks
- **Soft walls** (destructible) with wood grain and shine
- **Detailed outlines** for visual distinction
- **Texture patterns** for realism

### 6. **Power-ups** ⭐
- **Rotating square animation** for visual interest
- **Pulsing glow effect** that changes with time
- **Color-coded by type**:
  - 💣 Yellow - Bomb+ (more bombs)
  - 🔥 Orange - Fire+ (bigger explosions)
  - ⚡ Blue - Speed+ (move faster)
  - 🛡️ Purple - Shield (survive one hit)
  - 📡 Pink - Remote (detonate on command)
  - ⚔️ Green - Pierce (bombs go through walls)

## 🎨 Visual Theme

### Color Palette
```
PROUT_GREEN = (100, 200, 50)      # Main prout cloud color
PROUT_YELLOW = (200, 200, 50)     # Secondary prout puff
PROUT_BROWN = (139, 90, 43)       # Caca brown
DARK_BROWN = (101, 67, 33)        # Dark caca
STINK_GREEN = (150, 220, 100)     # Stink lines
PLAYER_GREEN = (0, 255, 0)        # Player color
PLAYER_RED = (255, 0, 0)          # AI color
```

### Animation Effects
- **Pulsing**: Sine wave-based scaling for breathing effect
- **Bobbing**: Vertical movement for character animation
- **Floating**: Smooth up-and-down motion for power-ups
- **Stink Lines**: Wavy, animated lines rising from objects
- **Expansion**: Explosions grow outward with particles
