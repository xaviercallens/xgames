## Technical Implementation

### Animation Techniques
1. **Sine Wave Pulsing**: `1.0 + 0.3 * sin(timer * 8)`
2. **Bobbing Motion**: `sin(frame * π) * 2`
3. **Rotating Squares**: `cos/sin(angle) * distance`
4. **Expanding Clouds**: `1.0 - (timer / max_timer)`
5. **Wavy Lines**: `sin((duration * 3 + offset) * 0.5)`
6. **Alpha Blending**: `int(255 * (timer / max_timer))`

### Rendering Pipeline
```
1. Background (checkerboard)
2. Walls (textured)
3. Cacas (poop piles)
4. Bombs (cloud effects)
5. Explosions (expanding)
6. Power-ups (rotating)
7. Players (characters)
8. UI (stats)
```
