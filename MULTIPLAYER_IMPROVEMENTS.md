## 🎯 Key Improvements

### 1. **Corner Spawn Positions** ✅

Each player spawns in a different corner of the map:

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ P1 (Human)                  │  Top-left: Player 1 (Human) - Green
│ 🟢                          │  
│                             │

│                             │  
│                             │  
│                             │

│                             │  
│                             │  
│                             │  
│                             │  
│                          🔵 │  Top-right: AI 2 - Blue
│                             │  
│                             │  
│                             │

│                             │  
│                             │  
│                             │  
│                             │  
│ 🟡                          │  Bottom-left: AI 3 - Yellow
│                             │  
│                             │  
│                             │  
│                             │  
│                             │  
│                             │  
│                             │  
│                             │  
│                             │  
│                             │  
│                             │  
│                          🔴 │  Bottom-right: AI 1 - Red
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Spawn Coordinates:**
- Player 1 (Human): `(1, 1)` - Top-left
- AI 1: `(GRID_SIZE-2, GRID_SIZE-2)` - Bottom-right
- AI 2: `(GRID_SIZE-2, 1)` - Top-right
- AI 3: `(1, GRID_SIZE-2)` - Bottom-left

### 2. **Longer Games** ✅

**New Game End Conditions:**

#### Human Loses
- Game ends when human player dies
- Remaining AI opponents win
- Message: "Winner: [AI Name]" or "[N] AI opponents survived"

#### Human Wins
- Game ends when ALL AI opponents are eliminated
- Human must defeat every AI to win
- Message: "🎉 VICTORY! 🎉 - You defeated all AI opponents!"

#### Draw
- Game ends if everyone dies simultaneously
- Message: "Draw - Everyone eliminated"

**Key Change:**
- **Before:** Game ended when only 1 player remained
- **After:** Game continues until human dies OR all AI are eliminated
- **Result:** Much longer, more strategic battles!

---

### 3. **Live Status Display** ✅

**During Gameplay:**

Top of screen shows:
```
YOU: ALIVE ✓                    AI OPPONENTS: 2/3 ALIVE

                                AI 1: ✓
                                AI 2: ✗
                                AI 3: ✓
```

**Features:**

### 4. **Enhanced Victory Screen** ✅

```

## 🎮 Gameplay Impact

### Strategic Depth
- **Multiple Threats:** Must track multiple AI opponents
- **Elimination Order:** Choose which AI to target first
- **Survival:** Stay alive while eliminating all AI
- **Longer Battles:** Games last much longer

### Difficulty Progression
- **1 AI:** Moderate challenge
- **2 AI:** Significant challenge (must eliminate both)
- **3 AI:** Expert level (must eliminate all three)

### Example Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Gradual Elimination
```
Start:    Human + AI 1 + AI 2 + AI 3 (all alive)
Mid-game: Human + AI 1 + AI 3 (AI 2 eliminated)
          → Game continues!
Late:     Human + AI 3 (AI 1 eliminated)
          → Game continues!
End:      Human only (AI 3 eliminated)
          → VICTORY!
```

#### Scenario 2: Human Elimination
```
Start:    Human + AI 1 + AI 2 (all alive)
Mid-game: Human eliminated
          → Game Over immediately
          → Winner: AI 1 or AI 2
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Code Changes

**Spawn System:**
```python
SPAWN_POSITIONS = [
    (1, 1),                      # Player 1 (Human) - Top-left
    (GRID_SIZE - 2, GRID_SIZE - 2),  # AI 1 - Bottom-right
    (GRID_SIZE - 2, 1),          # AI 2 - Top-right
    (1, GRID_SIZE - 2),          # AI 3 - Bottom-left
]
```

**Game End Logic:**
```python
human_alive = self.human_player.alive
ai_alive = [p for p in self.ai_players if p.alive]

if not human_alive:
    # Human lost - game over
    self.game_state.game_over = True
elif len(ai_alive) == 0:
    # All AI defeated - human wins!
    self.game_state.game_over = True
    self.game_state.winner = "Player 1 (You Win!)"
# Otherwise, game continues
```

**Status Display:**
```python
# Show human status
human_status = "YOU: " + ("ALIVE ✓" if human_alive else "ELIMINATED ✗")

# Show AI count
ai_alive_count = sum(1 for p in self.ai_players if p.alive)
ai_status = f"AI OPPONENTS: {ai_alive_count}/{len(self.ai_players)} ALIVE"

# Show individual AI status
for ai_player in self.ai_players:
    status = f"{ai_player.name}: " + ("✓" if ai_player.alive else "✗")
```
