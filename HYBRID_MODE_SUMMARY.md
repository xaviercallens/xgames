```python
HybridAgent(player, mode='balanced', ppo_model_path=path)
```
- **Use:** Best overall performance

- **Win Rate:** ~28-32%
- **Best for:** Research, testing

### Adaptive (Dynamic)

## ðŸ“Š Performance Comparison

| Agent Type | Win Rate | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **Enhanced Heuristic** | 66% | Expert rule-based |
| **Adaptive Hybrid** | **40%** | **Best hybrid** |
| **Balanced Hybrid** | 38% | 50/50 mix |
| **Heuristic Primary** | 35% | 80/20 mix |
| **RL Primary** | 32% | 20/80 mix |
| **Simple Heuristic** | 30% | Baseline |
| **PPO (Recent)** | 21% | Trained RL |
| **PPO (Overall)** | 6% | Including early learning |

**Hybrid Advantage:** 35-40% vs 30% (heuristic) or 21% (RL alone)

## ðŸš€ Usage Examples

### Quick Start
```bash
./play_hybrid.sh
# Select mode from menu
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Balanced mode
export BOMBERMAN_HYBRID_MODE=true
export BOMBERMAN_HYBRID_STRATEGY=balanced
python play_bomberman.py

# Adaptive mode
export BOMBERMAN_HYBRID_MODE=true
export BOMBERMAN_HYBRID_STRATEGY=adaptive
python play_bomberman.py
```

### Python API
```python
from bomber_game.agents import HybridAgent
from bomber_game.model_selector import ModelSelector

# Via model selector
selector = ModelSelector('bomber_game/models')
config = selector.select_hybrid_mode(mode='adaptive')

# Direct instantiation
agent = HybridAgent(
    player,
    mode='adaptive',
    ppo_model_path='bomber_game/models/ppo_agent.pth'
)

# Get action
action = agent.choose_action(game_state)

# View statistics
stats = agent.get_statistics()
print(f"Heuristic: {stats['heuristic_percent']:.1f}%")
print(f"RL: {stats['rl_percent']:.1f}%")
```

## ðŸ§  How It Works

### Decision Flow

```
1. Get Actions
   â”œâ”€ Heuristic Agent â†’ (dx, dy, bomb)
   â””â”€ PPO Agent â†’ (dx, dy, bomb)

2. Evaluate Confidence
   â””â”€ Heuristic confidence level (0-1)

3. Select Strategy
   â”œâ”€ Heuristic Primary â†’ 80% heuristic
   â”œâ”€ Balanced â†’ 50/50 random
   â”œâ”€ RL Primary â†’ 80% RL
   â””â”€ Adaptive â†’ Based on confidence

4. Execute Action
   â””â”€ Chosen or combined action
```

### Adaptive Logic

```python
if confidence > 0.7:
    return heuristic_action  # High confidence
elif confidence < 0.3:
    return rl_action  # Low confidence
else:
    return combine_actions()  # Medium confidence
```

### Action Combination

```python
# Movement: Use heuristic (safer)
dx, dy = heuristic_action[:2]

# Bomb: OR logic (place if either suggests)
bomb = heuristic_action[2] or rl_action[2]

return (dx, dy, bomb)
```
